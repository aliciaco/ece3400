# Qualitative Peer/Self Evaluation

### Name: Coto, Alicia
### Team Number: 2

(1.) On a scale from 1(poor) to 5(great), please judge the overall performance of your team: 5

(2.) In the table below, identify a major strength of each of your group members in relation to the group’s goals and processes. Provide one concrete example to substantiate your answer. Include yourself!

| Group member's name | Strength | Example |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
|Casazzone, Nicolas|Good website additions|Always adds lots of videos and pictures|
|Coto, Alicia|solid explanations|Makes sure every part of the process is explained on the website|
|Hornung, Ryan|Takes initiative|Started the simulations and made lots of improvements on his own|
|Pacheco, Raul|Tinkerer|Does a lot of the soldering and robot adjustments well|
|Roberge, Benjamin|Dedicated|Always goes to oepn lab hours when he is able to|

(3.) In the table below, identify a weakness of each of your group member’s in relation to the group’s process. Provide concrete examples to substantiate your answers. Include yourself!

| Group member’s name | Weakness | Example |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
|Casazzone, Nicolas|Lack of new ideas|Goes along with other people's ideas when trying to solve a problem|
|Coto, Alicia|Doesn't always explain what she's working on|Will make adjustments to the algorithm but not involve everyone in the conversation|
|Hornung, Ryan|Not always responsive|Sometimes he will not respond for a while or not check the website to add things before a deadline|
|Pacheco, Raul|lacks initiative|Needs to be given a project or told what to work on|
|Roberge, Benjamin|relatively quiet|Sometimes he doesn't make his ideas heard|

(4.) In the space below, identify approaches your group tried that worked well, and explain why they were effective.
In lab we have continued to work in similar groups and that allows for us to keep everyone on the same page. We have discovered who works well with who and play to peoples strengths. For example, Ryan and I are good at working on algorithms and will work on them together when working on milestones. In other labs when we must split into two groups and found that Ryan and Ben work well together and Raul, Nick and I also make a good team. 

(5.) In the space below, identify approaches your group tried that did not work well, and explain why they were ineffective.
When working on the last lab, there was not a lot of communication between the two teams. The FPGA team suffered because of this. The other team had previously worked with the FPGA and could have given pointers and advice before starting that would have make accomplishing the tasks easier.

(6.) What can you do to improve your own contributions to the group’s goals and processes in the final part of the semester?
We can make sure everyone is always working on something (not just watching other people work on a task). We have a lot of tasks that can be broken up, so as to be most efficient, we should ensure we delegate this tasks properly in order to finish everything.

(7.) Distribute points among the members of your team (not including you); a higher score means they have contributed more towards the team work. **The total points must sum to 1.**
*Example:
Alice: 0.25
Ben: 0.1
Charles: 0.25
Dave: 0.4*

### Scores:

Hornung, Ryan:  .3
Pacheco, Raul:  .2
Roberge, Benjamin: .25
